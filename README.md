MDB Mini Project 1- Match The Members
This app is a game where the user needs to match the picture of the MDB member from a multiple-choice set of 4 MDB members’ names. There is a score counter that counts how many times the user gets the answer right. When the user chooses the correct answer, the answer choice will be displayed green. However, when the user chooses the wrong answer, the user’s choice will be displayed as red, but the correct answer will be displayed as green. The user also needs to match the picture to the name within 5 seconds. Finally, the user will be able to see their longest streak of correct answers and the results of their last three questions.
